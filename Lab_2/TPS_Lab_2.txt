TPS Activity 2:
1. To compile punishment.c so that you can debug it using GDB, say gcc -g punishment.c -o "executable name";

4. Breakpoints can be set with br"#", where # is the line that you want the code to stop at just before running it.
5. To run the program line by line, press n for next.

7. Press c to continue the code until main is finished.
8. To exit gdb press q for quit.
