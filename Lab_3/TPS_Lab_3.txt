TPS Activity 1:

1. The three pools of memoery are the stack (for local variables), the heap (for dynamically
allocated variables/data) and static data(global variable storage, permanent for the 
entire run of the program)
2. a. 3 variables have been declared in mem.c
   b. 2 are pointers; ptr points to an address in the memory containing an int, and handle points to an address
      that stores another pointer.
   c. These 3 variables are stored in the stack.
   d. In line 12 ptr will point to a variable in the heap.


Assignment 1:
1. a. We need to pass the size of the array to the function to make sure we aren't manipulating data
      not a part of the array (i.e. garbage).
   b. The orgiinal array is not changed because we copy the data into a new array and sort THAT one.
   c. the main() function returns both he original array and the new sorted array, so it's good we have
      both versions.
