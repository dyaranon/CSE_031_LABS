TPS Activity 1:
4. a)To load an assembly file click open and find the .s file with your MIPS instructions.
   b)To assemble the program, click the wrench and screwdriver icon.
   c)To run the assembled program click the green go button.
   d)No you cannot run a program without assembling it.
   e)To run the assembled program line by line click the green go icon with the '1' subscripted next to it.
   f) Click the green reset button to run the program again.

TPS Activity 2:
1. .data is the section where data is stored in memory (allocated in RAM); .word refers to an integer value; .text are the MIPS instructions the compiler will look at.
2. Line 10 says if register t3 is equal to zero, jump to the 'finish' label.
3. Line 15 jumps back up the the 'fib' label to recursively run the method as long as line 10 does not jump to finish.
4. TO set a breakpoint go to the execute tab and click on the bkpt button next to the address where you want the program to stop.
5. TO continue to execute your code after a breakpoint just click the go button again; to step through the code click the 
   green go icon with the '1' subscripted next to it.
6. Click on the execute tab and look at the registers tab. Here it will show the content of all 32 registers.
7. n is stored in address 0x10010000; the 13th fibonacci number is 233
8. The syscall instruction is usually used for printing; the li instruction, or load immediate, loads a number into a register that tells
   syscall what to do. li $v0 1 means that syscall will print the contents of $v0, li $v0 10 would exit the program.
