TPS Activity 1:

5. We do not need to declare n in .data or use la or lw

TPS Activity 2:
1. The output is 29
4. $a0 will be used because register convention says to use it for aguments to functions.
5. It is expected to be stored in $v0 but it can be moved to $a0 because $v0 will be used for syscall.
7. 3 integer values are saved onto the stack; the first thing saved on a stack frame is the return address.
10. Saving  $a0 in the stack helps us compare it to the original value input
12. If recursion is called right away,  the new values from recursion will get written into the same register and the previous values will disappear.
15. The value that has to be retrieved is the return address, which is the address after the first recursion function is called
